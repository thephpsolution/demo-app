Demo App: Developer Invoice
=======================

This is an implementation of an invoicing system. The backend is ZF2 with Doctrine and ZfcUser. The frontend is a simple
bootstrap app with jQuery to provide the simple in-page dynamic features.

This should illustrate well how I would approach this problem: use off-the-shelf packages where available, take
advantage of the Zend Form validation, use Doctrine, OOP principles, etc.

Technologies not used here that I typically would for normal projects:
- Bower
- Vagrant
- PhpUnit
- Behat
- Grunt
